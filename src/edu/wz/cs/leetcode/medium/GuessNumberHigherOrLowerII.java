/**
 * 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II<br>
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii<br><br>
 * 
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:<br>
 * 
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.<br>
 * 
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.<br>
 * 
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the 
 * number I picked.<br>
 * 
 * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
